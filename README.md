## Creating the RPC

- API updates every 5 minutes
- RPC updates every 5 minutes to match the API
- Remaining time in the RPC is for knowing when is going to update

### *IMPORTANT* Installing nodejs and pkg

- Nodejs is needed to make the .exe at the end, you can downloaded from their page [Nodejs]
- Now we are going to need pkg, go to your terminal and type ```npm install -g pkg```

### Create a Discord APP üñ•Ô∏è

- Go to [DeveloperPortal]

- Inside there now we must add the logo for the RPC, add an image with the name "logo" (I already save the image you have to use inside the img folder)

### Files to config

- Now we go to the folder and modify/create an .env file and we paste the ID we copied earlier there
- Should be something like: applicationID=123456789012345678

- After that we need to change the username inside the config.json

### Build the .exe

- Now with everything configured we need to build the .exe, run the start.bat file
- Is going to create 3 files, one for each operating system, windows is the only i've been testing so you can delete the other two
- app-win.exe is what you have to run now in order to execute the retro mmo rpc, you can change the name/icon at any time

- now if you are not a user who frecuently uses nodejs you can unistall the package in your terminal typing ```npm uninstall pkg -g``` then unistalling node from your apps like a normal one

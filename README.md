- Inside there now we must add the logo for the RPC, add an image with the name "logo" (I already save the image you have to use inside the img folder)

### Files to config

- Now we go to the folder and modify/create an .env file and we paste the ID we copied earlier there
- Should be something like: applicationID=123456789012345678

- After that we need to change the username inside the config.json
